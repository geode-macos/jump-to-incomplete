# Jump to Incomplete

Sick of <cr>endless spam-clicking</c> in The Treasure Room just to get to a chest you want to open? Get this mod to give your finger a deserved rest and save some time!

## The button
In some scrollable menus you'll find this button:

![Jump button](xparadoxical.jump_to_incomplete/jump-button.png?scale=0.85)

Clicking it will take you directly to the next incomplete item on the list.

Supported menus:
- Treasure Room chests,
- achievements,
- main levels,
- gauntlets,
- map packs,
- shops,
- shards (no button, scrolls automatically).
